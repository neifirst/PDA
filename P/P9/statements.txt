Screenshot P9b contains an algorithm that I have chosen because it shows how a user's daily macro goals are set to a default on their first registration on a food tracker app. This involved using values contained as enums for each day of the week and for each macro we wanted to track, and populating a weekly list using nested for loops and if statements to make sure there was a value for each macro, for each day.
